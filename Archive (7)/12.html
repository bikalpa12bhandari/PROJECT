                The Lamborghini Miura is a sports car produced by Italian automaker Lamborghini between 1966 and 1973. The car was the first 
                automobile with a rear mid-engined two-seat layout, although the concept was first seen in a production road car with Ren√© Bonnet's 
                Matra Djet, introduced in 1964. This layout has since become the standard for high-performance sports cars. When released, it was the 
                fastest production road car.

                The Miura was originally conceived by Lamborghini's engineering team, which designed the car in its spare time against the wishes of 
                company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini, who preferred powerful yet sedate grand touring cars over the race car-derived machines produced 
                by local rival Ferrari. However, when the development mule was revealed to Ferruccio, he gave approval for its development to continue.

                The Miura's rolling chassis was presented at the 1965 Turin Auto Show, and the prototype P400 debuted at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show. 
                It received stellar receptions from showgoers and the motoring press alike, each impressed by Marcello Gandini's sleek styling and the 
                car's revolutionary mid-engine design.

                Lamborghini's flagship, the Miura received periodic updates and remained in production until 1973. A year later the Countach entered the 
                company's lineup, amid tumultuous financial times for the company.
